# Word-Count
The main file to be run is word-count.py which will prompt the user to input txt files,
then print to standard output a report of the top 10 most commonly occurring words
amongst the collection of files. 

Testing was conducted via testing.py, which can be rerun to verify the program's results.

All other txt files are to be used for testing purposes.
